### Featured Code
The code featured on this GitHub repo was individually written by me.

* **Model: Interests** - Written in Python, this code uses NLP to clusters users based on their interests, and provides recommendations according to these clusters.
* **Model: Associations** - This model uses the concepts of bipartite graph projection and associations from Network Analytics to make restaurant recommendations.
